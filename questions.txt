ok, i'm in insert mode in vim.

and now that I think of it. if i'm in insert mode, this is pretty much the same as any text editor. Not being able to move strait down is annoying, but I bet theres a trick for it. I bet theres also a plugin or something that gives you the number of line on the left and maybe even dots to indicate when its just a visual line. if you know what i mean.

Ok. So i'm going to try to consolidaate and update questions here. My first one is pretty simple.

??? what is the rc at the end of .vimrc and .zshrc? 

my guess is remote control, but that barely makes sense. 

It has been cool to make edits to all these hidden files. I'm starting to see how files like gitconfig etc have parameters that you add/edit to make changes to the program functions. 

You mentioned "process" in response to me refrencing PATH. that will be interesting. I wrote down four general topics to focus on and form questions about. Kind of thinking of them as segments in a semi-structured interview. The four catagories were

1) UNIX
-reading the art of unix programming
-getting more familure with command line navigation/commands
-setting permissions

2) Git/Github
-i'm taking this class thats pretty great
-failed the linked in quiz / half the questions were on rebasing
-merge conflicts and p4merge
-i'm using git/hub to share these questions and lots of other things

3) Python
-I want this to be my primary instrument t
-its my first love and i like data and its ease of style
-I need to fill in the holes and gradually dig in deeper 
-loops are something I need to really drill down on... so basic
-really get good at pandas and webscrapping/parsing

4) CS/Datastructures
-don't really know where to start here.. turing?
-I mentioned b-trees to jeff and he went "woah" and mentined another typ of branch that starts with a B.
-I would need some direction for this one or we can turn it more into the "process".. i'm sure theres some similarity.

Ok.. thats all for now. I will try to add to this stuff and maybe it will help me understand how git works!
